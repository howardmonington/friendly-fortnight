    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells in a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected.\n",
    "- Leave all of your code cells executed and the output displayed before submitting your final notebook. That way, we do not need to re-run all of the simulations, which can be time-consuming.\n",
