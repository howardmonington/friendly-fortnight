    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells in a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected.\n",
    "- Leave all of your code cells executed and the output displayed before submitting your final notebook. That way, we do not need to re-run all of the simulations, which can be time-consuming.\n",

Write code to run at least 10 independent simulations of at least 50,000 trials each to estimate $P(C)$ and plot their running estimate curves on the same set of axes. **Hint**: This is a lot of computation, so try to leverage Numpy as much as possible so that your code doesn't run forever.

But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)\n",
