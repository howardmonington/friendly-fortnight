    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",

    "- Leave all of your code cells executed and the output displayed before submitting your final notebook. That way, we do not need to re-run all of the simulations, which can be time-consuming.\n",

When they leave work from the CU Engineering Center ($E~$), they each head for one of five other locations: the Gym to get strong ($G~$), the Library to get learned ($L~$), the Boulder Reservoir to have a nice swim ($R$), the Hill to have a sandwich ($H~$), or to Brewing Market to have a nice Coffee ($C~$).  \n",
